      <h2>Information for (New) Players</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Games should be played as doubles as much as
         possible. After each game finishes, allow anyone waiting to
         come on court and to mix up the teams.  Singles games should
         only be played if there are more court spaces than people
         present.</li>
         <li><strong>Please pay with cash or by card when you arrive
    at the courts.</strong> The fees cover the costs of organising the
    courts and the club and buying shuttles.</li>
         <li><strong>Please tick or add your name to the register in the
         black shuttlecock box each evening you attend.</strong></li>
         <li>Players don't have to stay the whole time, but can just
         come for part of the evening if they prefer.</li>
      </ul>
